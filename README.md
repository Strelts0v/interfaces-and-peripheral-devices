# interfaces-and-peripheral-devices
Here I will add materials and labs from course of "Interfaces and peripheral devices" (BSUIR university)

# lab-1. PCI (Implemented using c# and Visual Studio)
- List all devices connected to the PCI bus.
- For each device, specify DeviceID and VendorID in the decrypted (text) format.
# lab-2. HDD (Implemented using c++ and Linux OS)
Display information about the hard disk:
- model;
- firmware version;
- serial number;
- memory information (free / busy / total);
